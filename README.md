## Ignite-Call

  
This repo is a reprodution of the final app builded in the **React.js** course of **Rocketseat**. 


## Next 13 - App router

Instead of using the pages folder as is originally builded in the lessons from the course, i attemped to recreate the app using the [App router](https://nextjs.org/docs/app) from **Next 13**. I don't think i did a great job at working with the client and server side components, i'm sure that theres more perfomatic ways of implementing that code, but i had fun with the challenge.

  

```bash

npm  run  dev

# or

yarn  dev

# or

pnpm  dev

# or

bun  dev

```

  

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

# Unfinished
